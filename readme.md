# Backend for FaceRecognition application
## How to make things work:
- Use Python 3.9.2

## Throubleshooting
Possible issues are with incompatible packages, try using 'virtualenv' instead of default pip folder. Make sure that you use proper Python version.
If there is a problem with pip install, try using:
```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```
